# Team Manager Api

## 📘 Project Description
**Team Manager API** is a RESTful backend service designed to manage users and their associated teams in a many-to-many relationship. This project was developed as part of a focused learning sprint/refresher to deepen expertise in backend architecture, **object oriented programming**, **relational database design**, and **cloud deployment readiness** for real-world, scalable applications.

<!-- ## 🧠 Key Features
- Modular, OOP-based architecture using TypeScript classes and service layers
- PostgreSQL schema with many-to-many relationships and Prisma ORM
- Redis (optional) caching layer for performance optimization
- Full containerization via Docker and orchestration with Docker Compose
- Designed with scalability, maintainability, and best practices in mind
- CI/CD-ready and deployable to platforms like Azure or Render

## 🔍 Why This Project?
This project was created to demonstrate proficiency in technologies and patterns commonly used in modern backend engineering roles, particularly those emphasized in senior-level positions such as:
- Service abstraction and architecture design
- Relational database schema modeling and query logic
- Scalable application deployment with Docker
- Clean code principles and organized folder structure

## 🚀 Goals
- Solidify Node.js + Express knowledge beyond CRUD-level apps
- Practice applying SOLID principles and TypeScript for backend systems
- Build deployable, production-style infrastructure using Docker
- Create a live, shareable repo for interview conversations -->
